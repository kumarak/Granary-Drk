/**
 * Registers a callback function for the basic block event.  DR calls
 * \p func before inserting a new basic block into the code cache.
 * When adding a basic block to a new trace, DR calls \p func again
 * with \p for_trace set to true, giving the client the opportunity to
 * keep its same instrumentation in the trace, or to change it.  The
 * original basic block's instrumentation is unchanged by whatever
 * action is taken in the \p for_trace call.
 *
 * DR may call \p func again if it needs to translate from code cache
 * addresses back to application addresses, which happens on faulting
 * instructions as well as in certain situations involving suspended
 * threads or forcibly relocated threads.  The \p translating
 * parameter distinguishes the two types of calls and is further
 * explained below.
 *
 * - \p drcontext is a pointer to the input program's machine context.
 * Clients should not inspect or modify the context; it is provided as
 * an opaque pointer (i.e., <tt>void *</tt>) to be passed to API
 * routines that require access to this internal data.
 * drcontext is specific to the current thread, but in normal
 * configurations the basic block being created is thread-shared: thus,
 * when allocating data structures with the same lifetime as the
 * basic block, usually global heap (#dr_global_alloc()) is a better
 * choice than heap tied to the thread that happened to first create
 * the basic block (#dr_thread_alloc()).  Thread-private heap is fine
 * for temporary structures such as instr_t and instrlist_t.
 *
 * - \p tag is a unique identifier for the basic block fragment.
 * Use dr_fragment_app_pc() to translate it to an application address.
 * - \p bb is a pointer to the list of instructions that comprise the
 * basic block.  Clients can examine, manipulate, or completely
 * replace the instructions in the list.
 *
 * - \p translating indicates whether this callback is for basic block
 * creation (false) or is for address translation (true).  This is
 * further explained below.
 *
 * \return a #dr_emit_flags_t flag.
 *
 * The user is free to inspect and modify the block before it
 * executes, but must adhere to the following restrictions:
 * - If there is more than one non-meta branch, only the last can be
 * conditional.
 * - A non-meta conditional branch or direct call must be the final
 * instruction in the block.
 * - There can only be one indirect branch (call, jump, or return) in
 * a basic block, and it must be the final instruction in the
 * block.
 * - The exit control-flow of a block ending in a system call or
 * int instruction cannot be changed, nor can instructions be inserted
 * after the system call or int instruction itself, unless
 * the system call or int instruction is removed entirely.
 * - The number of an interrupt cannot be changed.  (Note that the
 * parameter to a system call, normally kept in the eax register, can
 * be freely changed in a basic block: but not in a trace.)
 * - A system call or interrupt instruction can only be added
 * if it satisfies the above constraints: i.e., if it is the final
 * instruction in the block and the only system call or interrupt.
 * - The block's application source code (as indicated by the
 * translation targets, set by #instr_set_translation()) must remain
 * within the original bounds of the block (the one exception to this
 * is that a jump can translate to its target).  Otherwise, DR's cache
 * consistency algorithms cannot guarantee to properly invalidate the
 * block if the source application code is modified.  To send control
 * to other application code regions, truncate the block and use a
 * direct jump to target the desired address, which will then
 * materialize in the subsequent block, rather than embedding the
 * desired instructions in this block.
 * - There is a limit on the size of a basic block in the code cache.
 * DR performs its own modifications, especially on memory writes for
 * cache consistency of self-modifying (or false sharing) code
 * regions.  If an assert fires in debug build indicating a limit was
 * reached, either truncate blocks or use the -max_bb_instrs runtime
 * option to ask DR to make them smaller.
 *
 * To support transparent fault handling, DR must translate a fault in the
 * code cache into a fault at the corresponding application address.  DR
 * must also be able to translate when a suspended thread is examined by
 * the application or by DR itself for internal synchronization purposes.
 * If the client is only adding observational instrumentation (i.e., meta
 * instructions: see #instr_set_ok_to_mangle()) (which should not fault) and
 * is not modifying, reordering, or removing application instructions,
 * these details can be ignored.  In that case the client should return
 * #DR_EMIT_DEFAULT and set up its basic block callback to be deterministic
 * and idempotent.  If the client is performing modifications, then in
 * order for DR to properly translate a code cache address the client must
 * use #instr_set_translation() in the basic block creation callback to set
 * the corresponding application address (the address that should be
 * presented to the application as the faulting address, or the address
 * that should be restarted after a suspend) for each modified instruction
 * and each added non-meta instruction (see #instr_set_ok_to_mangle()).
 *
 * There are two methods for using the translated addresses:
 *
 * -# Return #DR_EMIT_STORE_TRANSLATIONS from the basic block creation
 *    callback.  DR will then store the translation addresses and use
 *    the stored information on a fault.  The basic block callback for
 *    \p tag will not be called with \p translating set to true.  Note
 *    that unless #DR_EMIT_STORE_TRANSLATIONS is also returned for \p
 *    for_trace calls (or #DR_EMIT_STORE_TRANSLATIONS is returned in
 *    the trace callback), each constituent block comprising the trace
 *    will need to be re-created with both \p for_trace and \p
 *    translating set to true.  Storing translations uses additional
 *    memory that can be significant: up to 20% in some cases, as it
 *    prevents DR from using its simple data structures and forces it
 *    to fall back to its complex, corner-case design.  This is why DR
 *    does not store all translations by default.
 * -# Return #DR_EMIT_DEFAULT from the basic block creation callback.
 *    DR will then call the callback again during fault translation
 *    with \p translating set to true.  All modifications to \p bb
 *    that were performed on the creation callback must be repeated on
 *    the translating callback.  This option is only possible when
 *    basic block modifications are deterministic and idempotent, but
 *    it saves memory.  Naturally, global state changes triggered by
 *    block creation should be wrapped in checks for \p translating
 *    being false.  Even in this case, #instr_set_translation() should
 *    be called for non-meta instructions even when \p translating is
 *    false, as DR may decide to store the translations at creation
 *    time for reasons of its own.
 *
 * Furthermore, if the client's modifications change any part of the
 * machine state besides the program counter, the client should use
 * #dr_register_restore_state_event() or
 * #dr_register_restore_state_ex_event() to restore the registers and
 * application memory to their original application values.
 *
 * For meta instructions that do not reference application memory
 * (i.e., they should not fault), leave the translation field as NULL.
 * A NULL value instructs DR to use the subsequent non-meta
 * instruction's translation as the application address, and to fail
 * when translating the full state.  Since the full state will only be
 * needed when relocating a thread (as stated, there will not be a
 * fault here), failure indicates that this is not a valid relocation
 * point, and DR's thread synchronization scheme will use another
 * spot.  If the translation field is set to a non-NULL value, the
 * client should be willing to also restore the rest of the machine
 * state at that point (restore spilled registers, etc.) via
 * #dr_register_restore_state_event() or
 * #dr_register_restore_state_ex_event().  This is necessary for meta
 * instructions that reference application memory.  DR takes care of
 * such potentially-faulting instructions added by its own API
 * routines (#dr_insert_clean_call() arguments that reference
 * application data, #dr_insert_mbr_instrumentation()'s read of
 * application indirect branch data, etc.)
 *
 * \note In order to present a more straightforward code stream to clients,
 * this release of DR disables several internal optimizations.  As a result,
 * some applications may see a performance degradation.  Applications making
 * heavy use of system calls are the most likely to be affected.
 * Future releases may allow clients some control over performance versus
 * visibility.
 *
 * \note If multiple clients are present, the instruction list for a
 * basic block passed to earlier-registered clients will contain the
 * instrumentation and modifications put in place by later-registered
 * clients.
 *
 * \note Basic blocks can be deleted due to hitting capacity limits or
 * cache consistency events (when the source application code of a
 * basic block is modified).  In that case, the client will see a new
 * basic block callback if the block is then executed again after
 * deletion.  The deletion event (#dr_register_delete_event()) will be
 * raised at deletion time.
 *
 * \note If the -thread_private runtime option is specified, clients
 * should expect to see duplicate tags for separate threads, albeit
 * with different dcrcontext values.  Additionally, DR employs a
 * cache-sizing algorithm for thread private operation that
 * proactively deletes fragments.  Even with thread-shared caches
 * enabled, however, certain situations cause DR to emit
 * thread-private basic blocks (e.g., self-modifying code).  In this
 * case, clients should be prepared to see duplicate tags without an
 * intermediate deletion.

 *
 * - The callback function returns a boolean indicating the success of
 *   the translation.  When DR is translating not for a fault but for
 *   thread relocation, the \p restore_memory parameter will be false.
 *   Such translation can target a meta-instruction that can fault

 *   can choose not to translate.  Such instructions do not always
 *   require full translation for faults, and allowing translation
 *   failure removes the requirement that a client must translate at
 *   all such instructions.  Note, however, that returning false can
 *   cause performance degradation as DR must then resume the thread
 *   and attempt to re-suspend it at a safer spot.  Clients must
 *   return true for translation points in application code in order
 *   to avoid catastropic failure to suspend, and should thus identify
 *   whether translation points are inside their own instrumentation
 *   before returning false.  Translation for relocation will never
 *   occur in meta instructions, so clients only need to look for
 *   meta-may-fault instructions.  Clients should never return false
 *   when \p restore_memory is true.
