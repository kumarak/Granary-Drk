wrap this in DOLOG in instr_encode_common:
        DOLOG(3, LOG_EMIT, {instr_disassemble(dcontext, instr, THREAD); });

* recreate_app_state_from_info needs to set instr's translation field so
  translate_walk_track doesn't return; thinking it's a clean call.

* encoding an immediate operand should work if the address is naturally sign
  extended. See revision 381 vs 382.

* setting ibl_branch_type in client_process_bb. This is needed when the exit CTI
  type is changed by the client (e.g., from a call to a ret). This came up when
  I was doing function wrapping.

* umbra: indirect calls like call* 0(%rax) have the address of the address
         incorrectly calculated as lea -8(%rax) -- the offset should be 0, not
         -8.
